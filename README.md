## Chess-Game-AI


## Reward performance
1. Create a Basic ChessPiece Class:
- Include attributes such as color, name, and possibly the current position.
- Define a method for moving the chess piece.
2. Create Classes for Each Type of Chess Piece:
- Each class should inherit from the ChessPiece class.
- Define how each type of chess piece moves.
3. Create a ChessBoard Class:
- Represent the chessboard using a 2D matrix.
- Implement methods to draw the chessboard and place chess pieces.
4. Create a ChessGame Class:
- Initialize the chessboard and place chess pieces at the start.
- Implement the main loop for player turns.
- Get input from the player (e.g., current coordinates and destination coordinates).
- Check the validity of the move and execute it.
5. Check for Win Conditions and End the Game:
- Check for win conditions after each player's turn.
- Display a victory message and end the game when appropriate.
6. Add Advanced Features (Optional):
- Add special rules like "En passant," "Castling," or "Pawn promotion."
- Optimize and make the user interface more user-friendly.
7. Optimize and Fine-Tune:
- Test and debug your game.
- Optimize your code if necessary.

## Idea
1 Graphics with Pygame:
- Use the Pygame library to create a graphical interface for the chess game. You can draw the chessboard and chess pieces using images and add animations for moves.
2 Check Valid Moves:
- Write a function to check the validity of each move based on the basic rules of chess. Limit the movement of each piece according to the rules.
3 Implement Chess AI:
- Add the ability to play against the computer. Use an algorithm like Minimax to optimize strategies and evaluate the current board position.
4 Record Move History:
- Keep track of and display the history of moves so that players can review the game.
5 Online Multiplayer:
- Connect the game to a network to allow players to play with each other remotely.
6 Statistics and Scoring:
- Track the number of wins, losses, and draws, and display players' scores.
7 Integrate Sound:
- Add sound effects for important events such as moving pieces, checkmate, or the end of the game.

class ChessGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = self.init_board()

    def init_board(self):
        # Initialize the chessboard
        pass

    def display_board(self):
        # Display the chessboard
        pass

    def is_valid_move(self, move):
        # Check the validity of the move
        pass

    def make_move(self, move):
        # Execute the move on the chessboard
        pass

# Usage
chess_game = ChessGame()
chess_game.display_board()
```
