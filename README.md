## Reward performance
1. Create a Basic ChessPiece Class:
- Include attributes such as color, name, and possibly the current position.
- Define a method for moving the chess piece.
2. Create Classes for Each Type of Chess Piece:
- Each class should inherit from the ChessPiece class.
- Define how each type of chess piece moves.
3. Create a ChessBoard Class:
- Represent the chessboard using a 2D matrix.
- Implement methods to draw the chessboard and place chess pieces.
4. Create a ChessGame Class:
- Initialize the chessboard and place chess pieces at the start.
- Implement the main loop for player turns.
- Get input from the player (e.g., current coordinates and destination coordinates).
- Check the validity of the move and execute it.
5. Check for Win Conditions and End the Game:
- Check for win conditions after each player's turn.
- Display a victory message and end the game when appropriate.
6. Add Advanced Features (Optional):
- Add special rules like "En passant," "Castling," or "Pawn promotion."
- Optimize and make the user interface more user-friendly.
7. Optimize and Fine-Tune:
- Test and debug your game.
- Optimize your code if necessary.

## Idea
1 Graphics with Pygame:
- Use the Pygame library to create a graphical interface for the chess game. You can draw the chessboard and chess pieces using images and add animations for moves.
2 Check Valid Moves:
- Write a function to check the validity of each move based on the basic rules of chess. Limit the movement of each piece according to the rules.
3 Implement Chess AI:
- Add the ability to play against the computer. Use an algorithm like Minimax to optimize strategies and evaluate the current board position.
4 Record Move History:
- Keep track of and display the history of moves so that players can review the game.
5 Online Multiplayer:
- Connect the game to a network to allow players to play with each other remotely.
6 Statistics and Scoring:
- Track the number of wins, losses, and draws, and display players' scores.
7 Integrate Sound:
- Add sound effects for important events such as moving pieces, checkmate, or the end of the game.

### Data Structure Design
```
class ChessPiece:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

class Pawn(ChessPiece):
    def __init__(self, color):
        super().__init__(color)

class ChessBoard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = [[None] * 8 for _ in range(8)]

    def initialize_board(self):
        # Initialize the board with pieces
        pass

    def display_board(self):
        # Display the current state of the board
        pass

class Player:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

    def make_move(self, from_position, to_position):
        # Handle player's move
        pass
```

### Chessboard Display
```
class ChessGame:
    def __init__(self):
        self.board = ChessBoard()
        self.board.initialize_board()
        self.player1 = Player("white")
        self.player2 = Player("black")
        self.current_player = self.player1

        # Pygame setup
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))
        pygame.display.set_caption("Chess Game")

    def draw_board(self):
        # Draw the chess board using Pygame
        pass

    def run(self):
        while True:
            for event in pygame.event.get():
                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                    pygame.quit()
                    quit()

                if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
                    # Handle player's move
                    pass

            self.draw_board()
            pygame.display.update()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    game = ChessGame()
    game.run()
```
### Move Processing and Playing Logic
```
# Trong class ChessGame:
def handle_player_move(self, event):
    mouse_position = pygame.mouse.get_pos()
    clicked_column = mouse_position[0] // (800 // 8)
    clicked_row = mouse_position[1] // (600 // 8)

    if self.board.board[clicked_row][clicked_column] is not None:
        piece = self.board.board[clicked_row][clicked_column]
        if piece.color == self.current_player.color:
            # Player clicked on their own piece
            pass
    else:
        # Player clicked on an empty square
        pass

# Thêm vào vòng lặp while:
if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:
    self.handle_player_move(event)
```
### Build AI using Minimax
```
def ai_make_move(self):
    # Implement Minimax algorithm to make AI move
    pass

# Thêm vào vòng lặp while:
if self.current_player == self.player2:
    self.ai_make_move()
```
